    "How does chronic kidney disease influence cardiovascular disease risk?",

    "Why should COPD patients be screened for ASCVD and ASCVD risk factors?",
    "Which inflammatory disease has the strongest evidence for increasing cardiovascular disease risk and by how much?"
  ],
  "answers": [
    "CKD significantly increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with worsening risk as kidney function declines below an eGFR of about 60–75 mL/min/1.73m².",
    "CKD is defined by abnormalities in kidney structure or function for more than 3 months, including markers such as albuminuria and an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m².",
    "Inflammation, oxidative stress, and promotors of vascular calcification are nontraditional ASCVD risk factors seen in CKD patients.",
    "Because COPD is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk and can interfere with diagnostic accuracy for cardiac testing, cardiovascular evaluation is important.",
    "Rheumatoid arthritis has the strongest evidence, increasing cardiovascular disease risk by approximately 50% beyond established risk factors."
