  "answers": [
    "A stepwise approach helps clinicians decide whether surgery can safely proceed or if further cardiac evaluation is needed, guiding perioperative risk assessment and planning.",
    "Cardiovascular screening and treatment should follow the same indications as nonsurgical patients, timed carefully to avoid delaying surgery, and chosen to prevent overscreening and overtreatment.",
    "Stress testing should be used judiciously, especially in lower-risk patients, and only when the testing would be clinically appropriate independent of the planned surgery.",
    "New therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes, have important perioperative implications. SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped 3 to 4 days before surgery to reduce the risk of perioperative ketoacidosis, and other therapies for heart failure and obesity may require careful management.",
    "Perioperative bridging with oral anticoagulants should be limited to patients at highest thrombotic risk. Patients with newly diagnosed AF after surgery require close follow-up to address reversible causes, consider rhythm control, and evaluate the need for long-term anticoagulation."
