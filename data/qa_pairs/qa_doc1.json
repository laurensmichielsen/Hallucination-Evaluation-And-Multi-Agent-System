    "answers": [
        "Ticagrelor or prasugrel are recommended, preferred over clopidogrel for ACS patients undergoing PCI.",
        "At least 12 months, with strategies such as proton pump inhibitors, ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 month, or aspirin discontinuation in patients on long-term anticoagulation to reduce bleeding risk.",
        "High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all ACS patients. For those already on maximally tolerated statins: add a non-statin agent (e.g., ezetimibe, evolocumab, alirocumab, or inclisiran) if LDL cholesterol is ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Further intensification is reasonable in high-risk patients if LDL is 55 to <70 mg/dL (1.4 to <1.8 mmol/L).",
        "An invasive approach with intent to proceed with revascularization during hospitalization is recommended.",
        "Radial access is preferred over femoral to reduce bleeding and vascular complications, and intracoronary imaging is recommended to guide PCI in complex lesions."
